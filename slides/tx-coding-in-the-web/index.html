# Writing code in the web browser.

A history.
???
So, Coding in the web. It&#39;s a thing.

The history of web IDEs seems pretty sparse on the web, but things started more than ten years ago.

The earliest cloud IDEs I can find references to are eXo Cloud IDE and Cloud9 IDE between 2009-2011.

# Early Drawbacks

- Language support
- Performance and Crashes
- Source Code Management
- Features/Debugging

![that-animal](misc/angry-error.jpg)

???

- Coding was often processed using Javascript.
- Language support was rudimentary, 
- performance was subpar, 
- accidentally refreshing the page may cause things to crash or reset
- source code managment integration was often missing, 
- and debugging was very difficult, if not impossible.

Because of the poor developer experience, especially for &#34;non-web&#34; languages, few developers coded using web IDEs at the start.
But, time passes, and things get better. Let&#39;s skip the middle and fast-forward to now.

## Modern coding in the browser

Different tools for different goals
- Language Learning 
- Code Interviews
- Notebooks
- Write and Publish
- Collaboration-first 
- Enterprise and Cloud Focused
- Repository Superchargers

???

There&#39;s a bunch of stuff now in different flavors.

Companies are still trying to figure out what people want (and will pay for).

I&#39;m going to divide everything into roughly seven categories, and explain the goals of each.
- Language Learning 
- Code Interviews
- Notebooks
- Write and Publish
- Collaboration-first 
- Enterprise and Cloud Focused
- Repository Superchargers

# Repository Superchargers

My final category.

These are tools that make working with open source repositories easier. 

They open your repo in a customizable docker container that can allow you functionality that usually comes only on desktop IDEs.

There&#39;s also a streamlined commit and push process.


- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

Here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk about today.
---
# How are Gitpod and Codespaces similar?

- Broad language support, auto-complete, intellisense
- Configurable color themes
- Integrated debugger
- Integration with GitHub repositories
- Free tier available
- Uses Visual Studio Code*
- Allows VS Code Extensions*
- iPad support
- VNC Support

???
# How are Gitpod and Codespaces similar?

There are quite a few similarities between the two products.  

If you use one, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to use the other.

Both use VS Code by default, integrate with GitHub, and offer some pretty nice language support.

They can also be customized with different color themes and extensions.

# Gitpod and Codespaces - Practical Differences

- Gitpod has support for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Codespaces is limited to GitHub.
- Gitpod has been around since 2018 with a userbase and published pricing. Codespaces is still in beta as of 2021, though it is free if you can get in via the [sign-up page](https://github.com/features/codespaces/signup).
- Collaboration in Codespaces is done with VS Live Share. Gitpod handles collaboration via shared workspaces, or by creating shareable snapshots.
- Codespaces integrates with AI Copilot(beta) via a VS Code Extension, but you have to be accepted into both beta programs. Copilot is not available for Gitpod.
- There&#39;s a VS Code extension to allow you to connect a local install of VS Code GitHub Codespaces. Gitpod is working on connecting to local IDEs with [Gitpod Local Companion](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/develop/local-companion), but it is still in preview.
- If you&#39;re motivated, you can self-host Gitpod on kubernetes. It&#39;s not currently possible with Codespaces (though VS Codespaces did have that option).

| Tasks - Run commands before opening IDE           | Does not appear to support running commands before opening                    |

# Philosophical Differences

- Gitpod is [open-source](https://github.com/gitpod-io), Codespaces is proprietary.
- While [VS Code is open source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), Codespaces uses a proprietary version of VS Code.
- Extensions also work differently, Microsoft has the proprietary [Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), Gitpod uses the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/)
- Gitpod environments are designed to be ephemeral, rebuilt every time you need one. Codespaces seems to keep your container handy, and restarts it when you need it again, only rebuilding if you change the configuration of the container.
- Gitpod has an option to offload some of the compilation process outside of the startup process in what they call &#34;Prebuilds&#34;.  That seems cool.
- Gitpod also allows you to run tasks, like restoring packages or running commands before the web IDE starts.  I&#39;m not aware of Codespaces being able to do this.

Enough talking. Let&#39;s do a demo of Gitpod and Codespaces.

Note: I&#39;m not starting these virtual machines from scratch.  That seems like a disaster waiting to happen.

# Gitpod

???
- Show off Hugo site.
- Change color themes
- Show .gitpod.Dockerfile and .gitpod.yml 
- Note that &#34;tasks&#34; allow running a hugo server automatically

---

# GitHub Codespaces

- do dotnet restore
- Show off debugging.
- Show off Copilot.

Should I use Gitpod or Codespaces?

background-image: url(misc/both2.gif)

???

Which one should you use? Maybe both of them? I&#39;d certainly suggest trying Gitpod first, since you don&#39;t have to wait to do it. I certainly prefer it when working on Hugo Static Sites.

However, Codespaces is nice, too. Since GitHub is a Microsoft product, any new GitHub features may come to Codespaces first, though they may come in beta signup form like AI Copilot.

Both products are still under active development, so I would encourage you to pay attention to both Gitpod and Codespaces as they continue to add features and improve.
